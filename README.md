# Automatic Cognitive Tutor Generator

[Automatic Cognitive Tutor Generator](http://tutor-converter.herokuapp.com) help automate the process of creating [CTAT](https://github.com/CMUCTAT/CTAT) Example Tracing Tutor for Python Code Snippets. It's aim at creating program tracing table for new programming leaners using Python programming language.



The basic idea of [CTAT](https://github.com/CMUCTAT/CTAT) Example Tracing Tutor is to build a Behavior Graph for correctly executing the code and use this Behavior Graph as a reference point for the human input. In typical fashion, the tutor is generated by a creator going through the problem first and let the CTAT app record the creator's behavior, and later using recorded behavior as the ground truth Behavior Graph for the tutor. 



Here the system automates the process of creating the Behavior Graph for the code, by using the line by line debugging information from the Python ```dbd``` debugging modules. The debugging information collection process uses the same way as [PythonTutor](https://pythontutor.com/) created by Philip Guo do. You can look up the documents provided by [PythonTutor](https://pythontutor.com/) about the format of the debugging trace.

## Creating the Behavior Graph

The process of creating the Behavior Graph (*.brd file) is as follow:

1. Get the ```debugging trace``` of the code snippet
2. Analysis the ```debugging trace``` and create a ```cognitive model``` recording every time the value of a variable or the line of exection is changed.
3. Using the ```cognitive model``` to create the XML style Behavior Graph.
